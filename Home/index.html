      <p class="text">Welcome to my VAPA site! This is the site I will be using for the rest of the year, to show how I've progressed over time. The navigation bar at the top allows you to navigate between different pages. What will be on this site will be my projects, and just some general information about me. The sidebar allows you to visit parts of my site that aren't typically available, such as the projects I have done since starting. Currently, I don't have many, but that will change in due time.</p><br>

        <br>Minecraft has gone through many changes over the years, and it's clearly shown. If you go back through to different versions, you can see just how much the game has evolved. In this article, I'll be detailing what happened with each Minecraft update and what impact it made on the Minecraft community.
