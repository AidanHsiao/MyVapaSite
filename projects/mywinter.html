  <p class="title" style="font-size:100px;">My Winter (2019 - 2020)</p>
  <div class="row"> This winter break, I went to Taiwan, and Taipei in particular. Taipei is a very interesting place. I think that the main things to look out for in Taipei are good street food, as well as all the places you can go to view Taiwan's very interesting history. I had quite a bit of fun in Taipei, and I wrote it all down here.<br>

    <br>
    Since I lived in the very urban area of Taipei, the ZhongZheng (中正) district, there were things everywhere, anything that you would ever need. Clothing shops? Famous sightseeing areas? Good food? All of it can be found in Taipei. As I've said before, Taipei has tons of great local food, such as beef noodle soup (牛肉麵), huge slabs of fried chicken (雞排), and mountains of shaved ice (雪花冰). Here's just the basic rundown of all the things you can eat at Taipei, and some good locations where you can find that food in high quality and quantity.<br>

    <br>
    Taipei has a lot of historical buildings. While all of them might not be entertaining, they still have a place in Taiwan's "heart". From historical military buildings, to museums, to sightseeing areas, there are many places that are worth going to in Taipei.<br>

  <div class="row"> - Taipei 101 Observation Deck<br>
    - National Taipei Museum<br>
    - Taipei Arena<br>
	- Longshan Temple<br>
  </div>
	<div class="row">
	<br><br>Taipei isn't just food and sightseeing, however. In my opinion, one of the fantastic things about Taipei is the estabilshed transportation system. Taipei succeeded where San Francisco failed, in terms of the "bike loaning" system. Taipei has something called YouBike, which is one of the most convenient ways to travel, other that the fantastic subway.
