  <p class="title">Information on the coronavirus</p>
  <p>The coronavirus outbreak has a lot of people very worried about their own safety, and rightfully so! According to a <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">COVID-19 tracking website</a>, more than 200,000 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. It's become so serious that some counties in California have been prohibited non-essential travel outside of people's homes. However, there are basic precautions you can take to protect yourself from this constantly spreading virus. <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"> According to the WHO (World Health Organization)</a>, some include:</p>

      <h2>Wash your hands constantly</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">The main way to stop the coronavirus from going into your system is to constantly wash your hands with soap and water. As oversaid as it is, it genuinely does help. The reason why it helps is because the coronavirus is mostly transferred from object to hand contact. With that gone, the chance of you getting the coronavirus is considerably lowered.</div>

      <h2>Stay at least 6 feet away from others</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">While the coronavirus can be transferred through object to hand contact, the coronavirus is actually an airborne virus as well. What this means is that bits of the virus cling on to respiratory droplets (large or small) that are made and expelled everytime you breathe. These droplets can last for hours in the air. By staying 6 feet away from people, you lower the risk of breathing in these droplets.</div>

      <h2>Avoid touching your face</h2>
      <div style="margin:10px 20px;text-align:justify">Following up on what was said earlier, the coronavirus is transferred from object to hand, sure. However, the real problems arise when your hands touch your face, which is when the coronavirus really starts to enter your system and cause problems. The easiest way to prevent this, other than washing your hands, is to generally avoid touching your face, as the coronavirus will have next to no chance of actually entering your system, and will just stay on your hand. Of course, you will need to wash your hands.</div>

  <p>And finally, just be aware of what's going on. While many people can make jokes about the coronavirus, the numbers are constantly rising. In where we live, the situation has already become very bad, to the point where non-essential travel outside of the house is forbidden. To learn more, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html">the CDC have made a site</a> detailing everything the average person needs to know about the coronavirus and how to stop its spread.</p>
	<p class="title" style="font-size:40px">How to deal with shutdowns:</p><p>Here in California, Governor Newsom has ordered a state-wide lockdown in homes, only travelling outside for essential travel such as buying food. Personally, I've been quite indifferent about the shutdowns, because my life is basically just staying at home all day watching YouTube, but there are extraverts out there who are literally dying out there. Of course, the easiest way to deal with shutdowns while getting your daily dose of social activity is video calling. Everyone over the age of 65+ is kind of cringing at this notion, but this is the literal reason video calling was invented; in case talking in person wasn't an option. Of course, that's not the only way to talk to other people. By following the precautions mentioned above, I believe it's relatively safe to go outside with people you already know, if you go to somewhere not bustling with people.</p>
	<p class="title" style="font-size:40px">My opinion:</p><p>The coronavirus is obviously something huge, with action being taken everywhere in the world, and I believe that it wasn't overblown. Given the exponential nature of coronaviruses, another month to take action would be devastating. This was obviously shown in China, where action 1 to 2 months earlier could have majorly stopped coronavirus progression, as the virus was discovered in December 31, 2019.</p>
