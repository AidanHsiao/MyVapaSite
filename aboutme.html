      <p style="font-size:50px">General Information</p>
      <p>My name is Aidan Hsiao, and I'm 15 years old. I am an avid coder and game player. I'm bilingual, knowing both English and Mandarin, although I'm trying to get better at Mandarin. My hobbies include Rubik's cubes and video games, both of which are quite fun to me. In terms of coding, I'm not bad at both Python and HTML/CSS. The two subjects that I really enjoy at school are science and mathematics. </p>

      <p style="font-size:50px;text-align:right">Likes and Interests</p>
      <p style="text-align:right;">I really like things that make me happy (obviously), but that can be very difficult. I'm quite picky about the things I like, especially when it comes to a broad topic such as video games. I really enjoy some sandbox games, such as minecraft. I also enjoy rhythm games, and other asian-esque games. My interests are all invested into computer programming. Whether it be web design, or game design, I just love coding.</p>
