      <p class="text">Welcome to my VAPA site! This is the site I will be using for the rest of the year, to show how I've progressed over time. The navigation bar at the top allows you to navigate between different pages. What will be on this site will be my projects, and just some general information about me. The sidebar allows you to visit parts of my site that aren't typically available, such as the projects I have done since starting. Currently, I don't have many, but that will change in due time.</p>

        The reality of the coronavirus has really struck everybody recently. Since this whole ordeal started, there have been over 200,000 cases, making this already more dangerous than the SARS outbreak of 2003. This article details exactly how the coronavirus spreads (and how to stop it spreading to you), things to down in the downtime, and my opinion on the entire situation.</div>

        Over this winter break, I went to Taipei, Taiwan, and it was pretty fun! I hung out with some personal friends, had some good food, and took a little mini vacation in Tainan, which while boring, wasn't the worst place to go. Here in this journal, I detail what I did over the winter and give some good food and sightseeing recommendations.</div>

        <span id="bannertext">Minecraft has gone through many changes over the years, and it's clearly shown. If you go back through to different versions, you can see just how much the game has evolved. In this article, I'll be detailing what happened with each Minecraft update and what impact it made on the Minecraft community.</span> </div>

        <br>
        My first project in C# was to create tic-tac-toe, so I did! Using about 1200 lines of code, this game features 3 computer difficulty levels, smart AI, and a two player mode! The hardest part of making the code was definitely the AI, because each combination had to be coded in individually. Try it out! </div>
